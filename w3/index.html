            <p>These are probably the most common type of pen. They use a small rotating ball made of metal or ceramic to dispense ink as you write. Ballpoint pens are reliable, produce consistent lines, and are suitable for everyday writing tasks. They come in various ink colors and are available in disposable and refillable options.</p>

        <section id="Rollerball">
            <h2>Rollerball pens</h2>
            <img src="/tonyd-pub/img/rollerball.jpg" alt="rollerball">
            <p id="second" class="gray">Rollerball pens are similar to ballpoint pens but use water-based ink, which flows more freely. This results in smoother writing and richer ink colors. Rollerball pens typically offer a more effortless writing experience compared to ballpoint pens, but the ink may take longer to dry and can smudge on some types of paper.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Ballpoint Pens: These are the standard ballpoint pens commonly used for everyday writing tasks. They come in various colors and designs, with plastic or metal bodies.</li>
                <li>Retractable Ballpoint Pens: These pens have a retractable mechanism that allows the tip to be extended or retracted with a click or twist. This feature prevents the ink from drying out and makes them convenient for quick use.</li>

        <section id="Fountain">
            <h2>Fountain pens</h2>
            <img src="/tonyd-pub/img/fountain pen.jpg" alt="fountain">
            <p class="gray">Fountain pens have a classic design and use liquid ink delivered through a nib. The nib is usually made of metal and comes in various sizes and shapes, affecting the thickness and style of the line it produces. Fountain pens provide a smooth writing experience and can be more comfortable for extended writing sessions. They require more maintenance and care compared to ballpoint or rollerball pens.</p>
