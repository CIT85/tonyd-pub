/* Cascading in CSS */

/* Cascading in CSS combines styles to determine how HTML elements look. */

/* Specificity and order matter: more specific or later styles override others. */

/* Understanding cascading helps control appearance and maintain consistency. */
/*CSS Rules*/
/*CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling HTML documents.*/
/*A CSS ruleset consists of a selector and one or more declarations.*/
/*Selectors specify which elements the ruleset should apply to.*/
/*Declarations define the styling properties and their values.*/
/*CSS rulesets style HTML for layout, typography, colors, etc.*/
/*Key concepts: selectors, declarations, specificity, cascading.*/
/*ID in CSS*/
/* IDs are unique identifiers within an HTML document. They help you target and style specific elements without affecting others.*/

/*Styles applied with IDs override those applied with classes or elements. This means IDs are useful for giving priority to certain styles.*/

/* Browsers can quickly locate elements by ID, making CSS rules using IDs faster to apply.*/

/* IDs often represent important elements in your HTML. Using them in CSS makes your code clearer and easier to understand.*/
