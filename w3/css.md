/* Cascading in CSS */

/* Cascading in CSS combines styles to determine how HTML elements look. */

/* Specificity and order matter: more specific or later styles override others. */

/* Understanding cascading helps control appearance and maintain consistency. */
/*CSS Rules*/
/*CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling HTML documents.*/
/*A CSS ruleset consists of a selector and one or more declarations.*/
/*Selectors specify which elements the ruleset should apply to.*/
/*Declarations define the styling properties and their values.*/
/*CSS rulesets style HTML for layout, typography, colors, etc.*/
/*Key concepts: selectors, declarations, specificity, cascading.*/
/*ID in CSS*/
/* IDs are unique identifiers within an HTML document. They help you target and style specific elements without affecting others.*/

/*Styles applied with IDs override those applied with classes or elements. This means IDs are useful for giving priority to certain styles*/

/* Browsers can quickly locate elements by ID, making CSS rules using IDs faster to apply.*/

/* IDs often represent important elements in your HTML. Using them in CSS makes your code clearer and easier to understand.*/
/*Inheritance*/
/*some CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements.*/
/*This behavior ensures consistency and reduces redundancy in styling*/
/*Properties like font-family, font-size, color, and line-height are commonly inherited.*/
/*Child elements automatically inherit these properties from their ancestors unless overridden.*/
/*When you create forms with input boxes and buttons in HTML, they don't automatically look like the rest of your text. You have to tell them specifically how to look, even if you've already set a font for the whole webpage*/
/*You might think putting important next to your CSS rule will make it super special and override everything else. But it's kind of like shouting too loud in a conversation it's disruptive and can make things confusing. It's better to be polite and use clear instructions so everything flows smoothly*/
/*DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. It's like a reminder to be efficient and not say the same thing over and over again in your code.*/
/*different ways to specify color*/
/*Use color names like red, blue, green, etc.*/
/*Represent colors using hexadecimal notation (#RRGGBB)*/
/*Specify colors using the RGB functional notation (rgb())*/
/*Specify colors using the HSL functional notation (hsl())*/
/*Similar to HSL, but with an additional alpha value for opacity (hsla()).*/
